# Problem

One of the biggest pain points of this billion dollar crypto social app is the onboarding UX. Even when the founding team themselves did user interviews, they discovered it was hard for new users to get started, know where to post, and find like-minded people.

One solution has been to personally onboard new users one by one, but this is manual and won‚Äôt be scalable for bringing the next thousands of users onto the app.

With Farlo, your have a personal onboarding buddy that lives right inside Farcaster as a mini app. As a voice AI agent, it's live 24/7, capable of guiding the next thousands of users to make their first cast, find the right channels, and get intros to new people!

# Roadmap

Going forward, Farlo will evolve into the Boardy AI of Farcaster. 

Imagine you can talk to someone who knows everyone and everything happening on the app. Whether it‚Äôs moving to a new city, career questions, or because of similar interests, social discovery is now 1 quick call away.

And unlike gated APIs by web2 social apps which make it difficult to build on top of, Farcaster is programmable, so the public user data + APIs lead to deeper + more meaningful connections. Farcaster also has primitives like mini apps, extensions, and a built-in crypto wallet, which makes it the perfect environment for social viral loops + growth experiments.
